# Stock-times-series-descriptive-and-predicitive-analysis
Stock price analytics using descriptive and predictive techniques using Python

The aim is to deliver a computer program written in python language which allows users to consult/analyse /model stock time-series.

I utilized historical stock data available in financial research platform (https://www.tiingo.com/), company lists from NASDAQ stock exchange website and python language to develop interactive program to establish statistical understanding of historical data and build models for prediction.

In first part of the program, I defined data gathering, extraction and transformation processes, followed by descriptive analytics using the prepared data of the trading price for user selected company and user given time duration. Various statistical understanding is displayed using graphical visual analytics based on historical user specified data.

In second part of the program, I used data prepared in first part in order to predict the closing price for the trading company by creating models. Linear and Non-Linear regression methods extensively used for predicting future closing stock prices for user specified modelling period.

The primary takeaway from this project was extensive understanding of Data Mining techniques using python language and extensive outreach in information extraction for large scale datasets. Program covers methods ranging from statistical to machine learning methods and knowledge acquired so far is applied in a real world scenario situation.
